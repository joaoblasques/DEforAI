## üìù Subchapter Notes Structure

Each subchapter note follows this template:

1. **Overview** - Brief introduction to the topic
2. **Learning Objectives** - What you'll master
3. **Core Concepts** - Key ideas with [TO BE FILLED] placeholders
4. **Practical Examples** - Real-world scenarios
5. **Code Examples** - Implementation templates
6. **Best Practices** - Recommended approaches
7. **Common Pitfalls** - What to avoid
8. **Hands-On Exercises** - Practice activities
9. **Related Concepts** - Links to other topics
10. **Further Reading** - References
11. **Key Takeaways** - Summary points
12. **Notes Section** - Your personal notes

### How to Complete Subchapter Notes

The subchapter notes are **templates** marked with `[TO BE FILLED]` placeholders. As you learn:

1. Research each topic section
2. Fill in the placeholders with your learnings
3. Add code examples from your practice
4. Document insights in the Notes Section
5. Create links to related concepts

This active learning approach helps internalize the material!
