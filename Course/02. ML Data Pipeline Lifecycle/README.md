# Chapter 02: The ML Data Pipeline Lifecycle

**Focus:** Understanding the complete lifecycle of ML data from generation to model serving

---

## 📋 Chapter Overview

This chapter explores the end-to-end ML data pipeline lifecycle, covering data generation, storage, feature engineering, model training data preparation, and serving patterns. You'll learn how data flows through an ML system and the engineering challenges at each stage.
