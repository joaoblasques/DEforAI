## 🎯 Project Approach

### Mini-Projects

Focused projects that target specific concepts from individual chapters:

**Suggested Mini-Projects:**

1. **Feature Store Implementation** (Chapters 9-10)
   - Build a simple feature store with Feast
   - Implement both online and offline stores
   - Create feature serving API

2. **Real-Time ML Pipeline** (Chapter 8)
   - Kafka-based streaming pipeline
   - Real-time feature computation
   - Low-latency model serving

3. **Data Quality Framework** (Chapter 14)
   - Great Expectations implementation
   - Automated validation pipeline
   - Data quality dashboard

4. **MLOps Pipeline** (Chapter 13)
   - CI/CD for ML data pipelines
   - Infrastructure as Code
   - Automated testing framework

5. **Vector Database RAG System** (Chapter 6)
   - Document ingestion pipeline
   - Embedding generation
   - Similarity search API
   - RAG implementation

## 📋 Project Guidelines

### Best Practices

1. **Start Simple**: Begin with MVP, then iterate
2. **Document Everything**: README, architecture diagrams, decisions
3. **Version Control**: Use Git from day one
4. **Test Thoroughly**: Unit tests, integration tests, data quality tests
5. **Monitor**: Implement observability early
6. **Security**: Follow least-privilege principles

### Deliverables

For each project, include:

- **README.md**: Overview, setup instructions, architecture
- **Architecture Diagram**: System design
- **Code**: Well-structured, commented, tested
- **Documentation**: API docs, runbooks
- **Demo**: Video or live demo
- **Reflection**: What you learned, challenges faced
