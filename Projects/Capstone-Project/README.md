## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

[TO BE FILLED - Add architecture diagram]

### Key Components

1. **Data Ingestion Layer**
   - Batch ingestion (Airflow)
   - Stream ingestion (Kafka)
   - CDC (Debezium or equivalent)

2. **Storage Layer**
   - Object storage (S3/GCS)
   - Lakehouse (Delta Lake/Iceberg)
   - Feature store (online + offline)

3. **Processing Layer**
   - Batch: Spark jobs
   - Streaming: Kafka Streams or Flink
   - Orchestration: Airflow/Dagster

4. **Serving Layer**
   - Feature API (REST/gRPC)
   - Online feature store
   - Model serving integration

5. **Quality & Monitoring**
   - Data quality (Great Expectations)
   - Pipeline monitoring (Prometheus/Grafana)
   - Drift detection
   - Alerting (PagerDuty/Slack)

6. **MLOps**
   - CI/CD (GitHub Actions)
   - IaC (Terraform)
   - Testing framework
   - Documentation
