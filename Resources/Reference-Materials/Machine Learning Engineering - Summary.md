# Machine Learning Engineering - Summary

**Author:** Andriy Burkov
**Type:** Book Summary
**Relevance:** Practical guide for operationalizing ML models - essential for data engineers working with ML systems

---

## Overview

Andriy Burkov's "Machine Learning Engineering" serves as a practical guide for operationalizing machine learning models, bridging the gap between theoretical ML research and real-world implementation challenges. The book emphasizes actionable knowledge for engineers, particularly those involved in building and maintaining ML systems.

**Core Message:** ML is Engineering, Not Just Science. The hardest problems are often engineering (data infrastructure, reproducibility, deployment, monitoring) rather than scientific (algorithm innovation).

## 1. Main Topics and Chapters Covered (ML Project Lifecycle)

The book structures the Machine Learning Engineering discipline around a comprehensive **ML Project Life Cycle**, which includes the following nine stages:

1. **Goal Definition:** Translating business problems into well-defined ML goals
2. **Data Collection & Preparation:** Sourcing, cleaning, and structuring data for ML
3. **Feature Engineering:** Transforming raw data into informative features
4. **Model Training (Part 1 & 2):** Selecting algorithms, training models, hyperparameter tuning, and addressing common issues like bias-variance. Includes both shallow and deep learning strategies
5. **Model Evaluation:** Assessing model performance offline and online, including statistical bounds and fairness
6. **Model Deployment:** Making the trained model available for use in production
7. **Model Serving:** The runtime environment and modes of delivering predictions
8. **Model Monitoring:** Continuously tracking model performance and system health in production
9. **Model Maintenance:** Strategies for updating and improving models over time

The book also covers foundational concepts (Introduction) and strategic considerations *Before the Project Starts*, such as project prioritization, complexity estimation, and team structuring.

## 2. Key Concepts and Frameworks

### Data Terminology
- **Directly vs. Indirectly Used Data:** Data used to form examples directly versus data used to enrich features (e.g., dictionaries)
- **Raw vs. Tidy Data:** Raw data is in its natural form, while tidy data is structured (rows as examples, columns as attributes/features)
- **Training, Validation, and Test Sets:** The standard partitioning strategy for model development and evaluation
- **Holdout Sets:** Validation and test sets, unseen by the learning algorithm

### Core Concepts
- **Machine Learning Pipeline:** A sequence of transformations and model training stages that convert raw data into a deployable model
- **Parameters vs. Hyperparameters:** Parameters are learned by the model; hyperparameters are set by the analyst to control the learning process
- **Baselines:** Simple algorithms (random prediction, zero rule) used as a reference point for comparing model performance
- **Bias-Variance Tradeoff:** The fundamental conflict between a model's ability to fit training data well (low bias) and its ability to generalize to unseen data (low variance)

### Regularization Techniques
- L1, L2 regularization
- Dropout
- Early stopping
- Batch normalization

### Performance Metrics

**Relational Data:**
- Synthesizing features (e.g., mean order amount, standard deviation of call duration) from joined tables for churn analysis

**Embeddings:**
- Word2Vec, Doc2Vec
- General embeddings for images (CNN, AlexNet) as learned features

**Data Augmentation:**
- Image transformations (flip, rotate, crop, color shift, noise)
- Text augmentation (synonym replacement, back translation) to increase dataset size and improve model robustness

### Model Evaluation in Practice

**Baselines:**
- Setting a human-level performance or simple heuristic as a baseline

**Metrics Selection:**
- Choosing precision for spam detection (avoid false positives)
- Recall for fraud detection (avoid false negatives)
- F-score for a balance
- Using nDCG for ranking

**A/B Testing:**
- Using G-test (for yes/no outcomes) and Z-test (for continuous metrics like time spent) to statistically compare new models in production

**Multi-Armed Bandit (UCB1):**
- Dynamically routing users to the best-performing model to balance exploration and exploitation in online experiments

### Deployment Scenarios

**On-device ML:**
- Deploying models using TensorFlow Lite, Core ML for mobile apps to reduce latency and preserve privacy

**Web Services:**
- Building REST/gRPC APIs using Flask/FastAPI (Python) or Plumber (R) for server-side inference, with autoscaling groups

**Containers:**
- Deploying models in Docker containers orchestrated by Kubernetes for resource efficiency and scalability

**Serverless:**
- Using cloud functions (AWS Lambda, Azure Functions) for cost-efficiency and simplified management

**Model Streaming:**
- Integrating models into stream-processing engines (Apache Storm, Spark, Flink) for real-time inference on continuous data

### Operational Logging
Logging user context, model inputs/outputs, and user reactions to aid debugging and future model improvements.

**Examples:**
- Device malfunction (vibration, firmware, usage)
- Credit risk (age, salary, debts)
- Ad display (webpage title, user position)

### Abuse Prevention
Strategies like reputation scoring, classifying user behavior, payment models, and progressive delays for requests to prevent model manipulation or unauthorized data extraction.

## 5. Notable Insights for Data Engineers

### Actionable Knowledge

1. **"Data First, Algorithm Second"**
   - Prioritize collecting high-quality, relevant, and sufficiently varied data over endlessly tweaking algorithms
   - Data augmentation is often more impactful than complex model architectures

2. **Embrace Imperfection**
   - ML models are not perfect and will make errors
   - Design systems to anticipate, detect, and gracefully handle these errors (e.g., fallbacks, "I don't know" responses)

3. **Reproducibility is Paramount**
   - Automate all data collection, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model training steps via scripts
   - Manual interventions are difficult to reproduce and scale

4. **Version Everything**
   - Data, feature extraction code, and models must be versioned and kept in sync
   - This is critical for debugging, rollbacks, and future improvements
   - Level 2 versioning (code + small data assets in Git, large files in object storage with unique IDs) is recommended for most projects

5. **Robust Data Infrastructure**
   - Invest in data infrastructure that provides accessible, sizeable, useable, understandable, and reliable data
   - This includes addressing data accessibility (legal, privacy, cost), quality (noise, bias, outliers, leakage), and storage (formats, levels, versioning, documentation)

6. **Beware of Data Leakage**
   - This is a major failure point
   - Always partition data (train/validation/test) *before* any feature engineering, imputation, or scaling steps that rely on global dataset statistics
   - Be vigilant for features that are functions of the target or "from the future"

7. **The Value of a Feature Store**
   - For large organizations, a feature store is a critical tool to ensure feature reuse, consistent definitions, efficient computation, synchronization between training and serving, and clear expiration policies

8. **Test Early and Often**
   - Test feature extractors thoroughly for correctness, speed, memory, and compatibility
   - Implement end-to-end and confidence tests for models during deployment

9. **Comprehensive Monitoring**
   - Don't just monitor model accuracy
   - Track data distribution shifts, prediction bias, numerical stability (NaNs), computational performance (latency, resource usage), and user engagement
   - Define alert thresholds carefully

10. **Iterative Refinement and Error Analysis**
    - Model development is iterative
    - Systematically analyze frequent error patterns (focused errors) on a small validation subset to guide feature engineering or data collection efforts

11. **Consider Business-Specific Metrics**
    - While standard ML metrics are useful, ultimately optimize for business objectives
    - Be prepared to tune hyperparameters to a business-specific performance measure, even if it slightly degrades a general ML metric

12. **Efficient Code is Key**
    - Write efficient, vectorized code (e.g., using NumPy) and leverage compiled libraries (C/C++)
    - Use specialized execution engines (MLeap)
    - Use profiling tools to identify bottlenecks
    - Parallelize training/inference where possible

13. **Manage Human Factors**
    - Account for human unpredictability, biases, expectations, and fatigue when designing ML systems
    - Gain user trust early, communicate model limitations, and provide options to report/undo errors
