## Overview

The ML data engineering tech stack is a carefully curated collection of tools and technologies designed to handle the unique requirements of machine learning systems. Unlike traditional data engineering stacks that focus primarily on analytics and reporting, the ML tech stack must support:

- **Dual-mode processing**: Both batch (for training) and real-time (for serving)
- **Feature computation and storage**: Centralized systems for feature engineering
- **Data versioning**: Reproducibility across experiments and models
- **Point-in-time correctness**: Historical feature values without data leakage
- **Low-latency serving**: Sub-100ms feature retrieval for inference
- **Large-scale transformations**: Processing terabytes to petabytes for training
- **Experiment tracking**: Managing hundreds or thousands of model experiments
- **Model deployment pipelines**: Automating the path from training to production

This subchapter provides a comprehensive overview of the modern ML data engineering tech stack, organized by function rather than vendor, helping you understand when to use each technology and how they integrate into a cohesive system.

## Practical Examples

### Example 1: Choosing a Feature Store

**Scenario:** E-commerce company building recommendation system with 10M users, 100K products, 1B events/month.

**Requirements:**
- Low-latency feature serving (<50ms p99)
- Batch feature computation (daily aggregations)
- Point-in-time correctness for training
- Team knows Python + SQL
- Multi-cloud (AWS + GCP)

**Evaluation:**

| Criteria | Feast | Tecton | Databricks FS | SageMaker FS |
|----------|-------|--------|---------------|--------------|
| **Latency** | ✅ <50ms (Redis) | ✅ <10ms | ✅ <50ms | ✅ <50ms |
| **Batch** | ✅ BigQuery/Snowflake | ✅ Built-in | ✅ Delta Lake | ✅ S3 + Athena |
| **Multi-cloud** | ✅ Yes | ✅ Yes | ❌ Single cloud | ❌ AWS only |
| **Cost** | ✅ Low (OSS) | ❌ High | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Medium |
| **Learning curve** | ⚠️ Medium | ⚠️ Medium | ✅ Easy (if using Databricks) | ✅ Easy (if using SageMaker) |
| **Maturity** | ✅ 3+ years | ✅ 5+ years | ⚠️ 2 years | ⚠️ 2 years |

**Decision: Feast**
- Multi-cloud requirement eliminates vendor-specific options
- Open source reduces lock-in and costs
- Redis online store meets latency requirements
- BigQuery offline store supports point-in-time joins
- Trade-off: More operational overhead than managed options

**Implementation plan:**
1. Deploy Feast on Kubernetes (EKS + GKE)
2. Configure Redis cluster for online store (AWS ElastiCache + GCP Memorystore)
3. Use BigQuery as offline store (multi-region)
4. Integrate with Airflow for batch feature computation
5. Build Python SDK wrapper for internal teams

---

### Example 2: Batch vs Stream Processing Architecture

**Scenario:** Fraud detection system for fintech with 10M transactions/day, 1M users.

**Requirements:**
- Real-time fraud scores (<100ms from transaction to decision)
- User behavior features (30-day aggregations)
- Transaction graph features (network analysis)
- Model retraining weekly on historical data

**Architecture Decision:**

**Batch Layer (Training):**
```
Data Source:        PostgreSQL (transactions) + S3 (historical)
Ingestion:          Debezium CDC → Kafka → S3 (Parquet)
Storage:            S3 + Delta Lake (ACID, time travel)
Processing:         Spark (daily aggregations, graph features)
Schedule:           Airflow (daily feature pipelines)
Output:             Feature Store offline (Snowflake)
```

**Streaming Layer (Serving):**
```
Data Source:        PostgreSQL transactions
Ingestion:          Debezium CDC → Kafka topics
Processing:         Kafka Streams (real-time aggregations)
Enrichment:         Join with online feature store (Redis)
Output:             Feature Store online (Redis) + Model serving API
Latency:            <50ms end-to-end
```

**Why Lambda Architecture:**
- **Batch** handles complex features (graph analysis, 30-day windows)
- **Streaming** handles simple, real-time features (transaction count in last 5 min)
- **Feature store** unifies both layers for serving
- **Consistent computation** via shared Python feature definitions

**Technology Stack:**
- **Stream processing:** Kafka Streams (stateful, exactly-once, simpler than Flink for this use case)
- **Batch processing:** Spark (complex transformations, graph algorithms via GraphFrames)
- **Feature store:** Feast (Snowflake offline, Redis online)
- **Orchestration:** Airflow (batch pipelines, model retraining)

---

### Example 3: Small Team Stack Selection

**Scenario:** 3-person startup building customer analytics SaaS.

**Requirements:**
- Ingest data from customer databases (PostgreSQL, MySQL)
- Transform and aggregate data for dashboards
- Train churn prediction models
- Limited engineering resources (focus on product)
- Budget-conscious

**Selected Stack:**

```
Ingestion:      Airbyte Cloud (no-code, 100+ connectors)
Storage:        BigQuery (serverless, pay-per-query)
Transformation: dbt Cloud (SQL-based, version control)
ML Platform:    Vertex AI (managed training + serving)
Feature Store:  BigQuery tables (simple, no dedicated feature store)
Orchestration:  dbt Cloud scheduler + Vertex AI Pipelines
Monitoring:     BigQuery monitoring + Google Cloud Logging
BI Layer:       Looker or Metabase
```

**Why This Stack:**
- **Minimal ops:** Everything managed (Airbyte Cloud, BigQuery, dbt Cloud, Vertex AI)
- **SQL-first:** dbt allows analytics engineers to own transformations
- **Cost-effective:** Pay-per-use pricing, no idle clusters
- **Integrated:** All GCP services work seamlessly together
- **Scalable:** Can grow to billions of rows without re-architecture

**Trade-offs Accepted:**
- **Vendor lock-in:** Heavily GCP-dependent (acceptable for early stage)
- **Limited customization:** Using managed services limits control
- **Higher unit cost:** Managed services cost more than self-hosted (but total cost lower with 3-person team)

**Migration Path (if growth requires it):**
1. Replace Airbyte with custom Kafka + Spark pipelines
2. Migrate BigQuery → Iceberg on S3 (data portability)
3. Replace dbt → Spark jobs (more complex transformations)
4. Add Feast for feature store (dedicated low-latency serving)

1. **Single source of truth:** Features defined once in `feast_features.py`
2. **Dual-mode:** Same features for training (offline) and serving (online)
3. **Point-in-time correctness:** `get_historical_features` prevents data leakage
4. **Low-latency serving:** `get_online_features` from Redis (<10ms)
5. **Materialization:** Background job syncs offline → online store

### Example 2: Real-Time Feature Computation with Kafka Streams

```java
// RealTimeFeaturesApp.java - Kafka Streams for live feature computation
import org.apache.kafka.streams.KafkaStreams;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.StreamsBuilder;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.kstream.*;
import org.apache.kafka.streams.state.Stores;
import java.time.Duration;

public class RealTimeFeaturesApp {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StreamsBuilder builder = new StreamsBuilder();

        // Input stream: user transactions
        KStream<String, Transaction> transactions = builder.stream(
            "transactions",
            Consumed.with(Serdes.String(), transactionSerde)
        );

        // Feature 1: Transaction count in last 5 minutes (tumbling window)
        KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> txnCountLast5Min = transactions
            .groupByKey()
            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeWithNoGrace(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
            .count(Materialized.as("txn-count-5min-store"));

        // Feature 2: Average transaction amount in last 5 minutes
        KTable<Windowed<String>, Double> avgAmountLast5Min = transactions
            .groupByKey()
            .windowedBy(TimeWindows.ofSizeWithNoGrace(Duration.ofMinutes(5)))
            .aggregate(
                () -> new AggregateValue(0.0, 0L),
                (key, txn, agg) -> new AggregateValue(
                    agg.sum + txn.amount,
                    agg.count + 1
                ),
                Materialized.with(Serdes.String(), aggregateSerde)
            )
            .mapValues(agg -> agg.sum / agg.count);

        // Feature 3: User transaction velocity (session-based)
        KTable<Windowed<String>, Long> sessionVelocity = transactions
            .groupByKey()
            .windowedBy(SessionWindows.ofInactivityGapWithNoGrace(Duration.ofMinutes(30)))
            .count(Materialized.as("session-velocity-store"));

        // Write features to output topic (consumed by feature store sync job)
        txnCountLast5Min
            .toStream()
            .map((windowedKey, count) -> KeyValue.pair(
                windowedKey.key(),
                new FeatureValue("txn_count_5min", count, windowedKey.window().end())
            ))
            .to("features-output", Produced.with(Serdes.String(), featureSerde));

        // Start Kafka Streams application
        KafkaStreams streams = new KafkaStreams(builder.build(), getConfig());
        streams.start();

        // Graceful shutdown
        Runtime.getRuntime().addShutdownHook(new Thread(streams::close));
    }
}
```

```python
# sync_streaming_features.py - Sync Kafka Streams output to Redis
from kafka import KafkaConsumer
import redis
import json

def sync_features_to_redis():
    """
    Consume features from Kafka and write to Redis (online feature store).

    This bridges Kafka Streams (real-time computation) and Feast (serving).
    """
    consumer = KafkaConsumer(
        'features-output',
        bootstrap_servers='localhost:9092',
        value_deserializer=lambda m: json.loads(m.decode('utf-8'))
    )

    redis_client = redis.Redis(host='localhost', port=6379, db=0)

    for message in consumer:
        feature = message.value

        # Store in Redis with Feast-compatible key format
        # Format: entity_name:entity_value:feature_name
        key = f"user_id:{feature['user_id']}:realtime_features"

        # Store as hash
        redis_client.hset(key, feature['feature_name'], feature['value'])
        redis_client.expire(key, 3600)  # 1-hour TTL

        print(f"Synced feature: {key} -> {feature['feature_name']}={feature['value']}")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    sync_features_to_redis()
```

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Stateful processing:** Kafka Streams maintains windowed aggregations in local state stores
2. **Multiple window types:** Tumbling (fixed 5-min), session (inactivity-based)
3. **Bridge to feature store:** Write results to Kafka topic → consume and sync to Redis
4. **Low latency:** End-to-end <1 second from event to feature availability

### Example 3: Data Quality Checks with Great Expectations

```python
# validate_features.py - Data quality checks before publishing features
import great_expectations as gx
from great_expectations.checkpoint import Checkpoint
import pandas as pd

def validate_user_features(df: pd.DataFrame) -> bool:
    """
    Validate user feature DataFrame before publishing to feature store.

    Returns True if all expectations pass, raises exception otherwise.
    """
    # Initialize Great Expectations context
    context = gx.get_context()

    # Create expectation suite
    suite = context.create_expectation_suite(
        expectation_suite_name="user_features_suite",
        overwrite_existing=True
    )

    # Define expectations

    # 1. Schema validation
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectTableColumnsToMatchOrderedList(
            column_list=[
                "user_id", "event_timestamp", "total_purchases",
                "avg_purchase_amount", "days_since_last_purchase",
                "user_lifetime_value"
            ]
        )
    )

    # 2. Nullability checks
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="user_id")
    )
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToNotBeNull(column="event_timestamp")
    )

    # 3. Value range checks
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
            column="total_purchases",
            min_value=0,
            max_value=10000  # Business rule: flag users with >10K purchases
        )
    )
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeBetween(
            column="avg_purchase_amount",
            min_value=0,
            max_value=1000000  # Flag anomalies
        )
    )

    # 4. Statistical checks (detect distribution drift)
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnMeanToBeBetween(
            column="avg_purchase_amount",
            min_value=20.0,   # Historical baseline
            max_value=150.0
        )
    )
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnStdevToBeBetween(
            column="avg_purchase_amount",
            min_value=10.0,
            max_value=200.0
        )
    )

    # 5. Uniqueness check
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnValuesToBeUnique(column="user_id")
    )

    # 6. Freshness check (data should be recent)
    suite.add_expectation(
        gx.expectations.ExpectColumnMaxToBeBetween(
            column="event_timestamp",
            min_value=pd.Timestamp.now() - pd.Timedelta(days=2),
            max_value=pd.Timestamp.now() + pd.Timedelta(hours=1)  # Allow small clock skew
        )
    )

    # Create batch and validate
    batch = context.sources.add_pandas("user_features_source").read_dataframe(df)

    # Run validation
    results = batch.validate(suite)

    # Check if validation passed
    if not results.success:
        # Log failed expectations
        for result in results.results:
            if not result.success:
                print(f"FAILED: {result.expectation_config.expectation_type}")
                print(f"  Details: {result.result}")

        raise ValueError("Feature validation failed! Check logs for details.")

    print(f"✅ All {len(results.results)} expectations passed!")
    return True

# Integrate into Airflow DAG
def feature_pipeline():
    # Step 1: Compute features (Spark job)
    features_df = compute_user_stats(...)

    # Step 2: Validate features
    validate_user_features(features_df)  # Will raise exception if validation fails

    # Step 3: Publish to feature store (only if validation passed)
    publish_features(features_df)
```

**Key Takeaways:**
1. **Automated validation:** Catches data quality issues before features reach production
2. **Multiple check types:** Schema, nullability, ranges, statistics, uniqueness, freshness
3. **Fail-fast:** Pipeline stops if validation fails (prevents bad data in feature store)
4. **Distribution drift:** Statistical checks detect when data distribution shifts

## Best Practices

### 1. Start Simple, Scale Thoughtfully

**Principle:** Don't over-engineer for scale you don't have yet.

**Recommendations:**
- **<1GB data:** Use Pandas, DuckDB, local processing
- **1-100GB:** Consider Polars, DuckDB, single-node Spark
- **100GB-10TB:** Distributed Spark, managed services (Databricks, EMR)
- **>10TB:** Optimize Spark, consider specialized engines (Presto for queries, Flink for streams)

**Anti-pattern:** Using Spark/Kubernetes for megabyte-scale data (massive overhead)

---

### 2. Prefer Managed Services Early, Self-Host at Scale

**Early Stage (<10 engineers):**
- Use managed services (BigQuery, Snowflake, SageMaker)
- Focus on product/model iteration, not infrastructure
- Accept higher unit costs for lower operational burden

**Growth Stage (10-50 engineers):**
- Mix managed + self-hosted (hybrid)
- Self-host core workflows (Spark, Airflow)
- Keep managed for undifferentiated heavy lifting (S3, databases)

**At Scale (>50 engineers):**
- Self-host most components (cost optimization)
- Invest in platform engineering teams
- Use managed for infrastructure layer only

---

### 3. Adopt Open Formats for Data Portability

**Always prefer:**
- **Parquet** over proprietary formats (columnar, compressed, widely supported)
- **Delta Lake / Iceberg** over vendor-specific lakehouses
- **Arrow** for in-memory data exchange
- **MLflow** for experiment tracking (framework-agnostic)

**Why:** Avoid lock-in, enable multi-engine access, future-proof architecture

**Example:** Store data in Iceberg format on S3 → query with Spark, Trino, Flink, Dremio, Athena

---

### 4. Implement Feature Stores Early for ML Projects

**When to introduce:**
- Multiple ML models sharing features
- Need for low-latency serving (<100ms)
- Training-serving skew is a risk
- Team size >5 ML engineers

**Benefits:**
- Feature reuse across models
- Eliminate training-serving skew
- Point-in-time correctness (no data leakage)
- Faster model development (features as a service)

**Start simple:**
- Phase 1: Shared SQL views in warehouse (low-latency not required)
- Phase 2: Batch feature store (offline only, e.g., BigQuery tables + versioning)
- Phase 3: Full feature store (offline + online, e.g., Feast or Tecton)

---

### 5. Version Everything

**What to version:**
- **Data:** DVC, LakeFS, Delta Lake time travel
- **Features:** Feature store with versioning (Feast, Tecton)
- **Models:** MLflow Model Registry, SageMaker Model Registry
- **Code:** Git (obviously)
- **Infrastructure:** Terraform state, versioned modules
- **Pipelines:** Airflow DAGs in Git, versioned Docker images

**Why:** Reproducibility, debugging, regulatory compliance, rollback capability

---

### 6. Build Observability from Day 1

**Three pillars:**
1. **Logs:** Application logs, data pipeline logs (ELK, Loki)
2. **Metrics:** Pipeline success rates, data volumes, latencies (Prometheus, Datadog)
3. **Traces:** Request flows across microservices (Jaeger, Zipkin)

**ML-specific observability:**
- **Data quality metrics:** Nulls, outliers, distribution shifts
- **Feature drift:** Statistical distance between training and serving distributions
- **Model performance:** Accuracy, precision, recall in production
- **Prediction latency:** p50, p95, p99 inference times

**Tools:**
- **Data quality:** Great Expectations, Soda, deequ
- **Drift detection:** Evidently AI, WhyLabs, Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor
- **Model monitoring:** MLflow, Weights & Biases, Neptune.ai

---

### 7. Embrace Infrastructure as Code

**Benefits:**
- Reproducible environments (dev, staging, prod)
- Version-controlled infrastructure
- Disaster recovery (rebuild from code)
- Multi-region deployments

**Recommendations:**
- **Terraform:** For cloud infrastructure (VPCs, S3, IAM, compute)
- **Helm charts:** For Kubernetes applications
- **Docker Compose:** For local development environments
- **CI/CD:** Automate infrastructure deployment (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI)

**Example structure:**
```
infrastructure/
├── terraform/
│   ├── modules/           # Reusable components
│   │   ├── s3-bucket/
│   │   ├── emr-cluster/
│   │   └── rds-database/
│   ├── environments/
│   │   ├── dev/
│   │   ├── staging/
│   │   └── prod/
│   └── main.tf
└── kubernetes/
    ├── feast/
    ├── airflow/
    └── monitoring/
```

---

### 8. Design for Failure

**Assume failures will happen:**
- Cloud regions go down
- APIs rate-limit or timeout
- Kafka brokers crash
- Spark jobs run out of memory

**Strategies:**
- **Retries with backoff:** Exponential backoff for transient failures
- **Circuit breakers:** Stop calling failing services
- **Idempotency:** Rerunning pipelines produces same results
- **Checkpointing:** Spark checkpoints, Kafka consumer offsets
- **Dead letter queues:** Capture failed messages for investigation
- **Multi-region:** Deploy critical components across regions

**Example (Airflow task with retries):**
```python
from airflow import DAG
from airflow.operators.python import PythonOperator
from datetime import timedelta

default_args = {
    'retries': 3,
    'retry_delay': timedelta(minutes=5),
    'retry_exponential_backoff': True,
    'max_retry_delay': timedelta(hours=1),
}

dag = DAG('resilient_pipeline', default_args=default_args)
```

---

### 9. Separate Compute and Storage

**Benefits:**
- Scale independently (more compute for complex jobs, same storage)
- Cost optimization (shut down compute when not needed)
- Multi-engine access (Spark, Presto, Flink on same data)

**Examples:**
- S3 (storage) + EMR (compute)
- GCS (storage) + Dataproc (compute)
- Snowflake (separate compute warehouses on shared storage)
- Delta Lake on S3 + Databricks clusters

---

### 10. Document Decision-Making

**What to document:**
- Architecture Decision Records (ADRs): Why you chose Feast over Tecton
- Runbooks: How to handle common production issues
- Data contracts: Schema, SLAs, ownership for datasets
- Onboarding guides: How new engineers get productive

**Format:**
```markdown
# ADR 001: Feature Store Selection

## Context
Need low-latency feature serving for recommendation system.

## Decision
Chose Feast over Tecton and SageMaker Feature Store.

## Rationale
- Multi-cloud requirement (AWS + GCP)
- Open source avoids vendor lock-in
- Team has Kubernetes expertise
- Budget constraints rule out Tecton

## Consequences
- Positive: Portability, cost savings
- Negative: More operational overhead, need to build UI
- Mitigation: Invest in monitoring, hiring DevOps engineer
```

---

## Common Pitfalls

### 1. Over-Optimization Too Early

**Problem:** Spending weeks optimizing a Spark job that runs once a day and processes 10GB.

**Impact:** Wasted engineering time, delayed product launches.

**Solution:**
- Optimize only when it's a bottleneck (>1 hour runtime, frequent failures)
- Use managed services to defer optimization
- Profile before optimizing (Spark UI, query plans)

---

### 2. Vendor Lock-In by Accident

**Problem:** Building entire pipeline with proprietary tools (e.g., all SageMaker) without considering migration.

**Impact:** Difficult to migrate, pricing changes impact budget, multi-cloud impossible.

**Solution:**
- Use open formats (Parquet, Delta Lake, Iceberg)
- Wrap vendor SDKs in abstraction layers
- Test portability periodically (e.g., run same pipeline on different cloud)
- Document vendor-specific dependencies

---

### 3. Ignoring Data Quality Until Production

**Problem:** No validation in development, bad data reaches production models.

**Impact:** Model performance degradation, incorrect predictions, customer impact.

**Solution:**
- Implement Great Expectations from day 1
- Validate data at ingestion, transformation, and before training
- Monitor data quality in production (drift detection)
- Fail pipelines on quality check failures

---

### 4. Not Planning for Scalability

**Problem:** Architecture works for 1GB but fails at 100GB (Pandas crashes, API timeouts).

**Impact:** Emergency rewrites, downtime, technical debt.

**Solution:**
- Understand data growth projections (10x in 1 year? 100x?)
- Choose technologies that scale (Spark > Pandas for >10GB)
- Load test systems before going to production
- Design horizontally scalable architectures (stateless services)

---

### 5. Treating ML Pipelines Like Software Pipelines

**Problem:** Using traditional CI/CD for ML without data/model versioning.

**Impact:** Can't reproduce experiments, models degrade without detection.

**Solution:**
- Version data (DVC, LakeFS) alongside code
- Use ML-specific orchestration (Kubeflow, Vertex Pipelines, Databricks)
- Implement model monitoring and retraining triggers
- Track lineage (data → features → model → predictions)

---

### 6. Underestimating Operational Complexity of Self-Hosting

**Problem:** "We'll save money by running our own Kafka cluster" (then spending 2 engineers' time on ops).

**Impact:** Hidden costs in engineering time, outages due to operational mistakes.

**Solution:**
- Calculate **total cost**: infrastructure + engineering time + opportunity cost
- Start with managed services, self-host only when:
  - Workload is predictable and high-volume (cost advantage)
  - Team has deep expertise in the technology
  - Managed service doesn't meet requirements (latency, customization)

---

### 7. No Disaster Recovery Plan

**Problem:** Single-region deployment, no backups, no tested recovery process.

**Impact:** Data loss, extended downtime during outages.

**Solution:**
- Backup critical data (S3 versioning, cross-region replication)
- Document recovery procedures (runbooks)
- Test recovery periodically (chaos engineering)
- Use multi-region for critical services

---

### 8. Poor Abstractions Leading to Duplicate Code

**Problem:** Copy-pasting feature engineering logic across notebooks, training scripts, serving APIs.

**Impact:** Training-serving skew, maintenance nightmare, bugs.

**Solution:**
- Use feature stores to define features once
- Create shared Python libraries for transformations
- Implement CI/CD for shared libraries
- Code review for reusable patterns

---

### 9. Not Considering Cost from the Start

**Problem:** Using expensive services without understanding pricing (e.g., BigQuery with unpartitioned queries).

**Impact:** Budget overruns, emergency cost-cutting, architecture changes.

**Solution:**
- Understand pricing models (per-query, per-GB, per-hour)
- Set up cost monitoring and alerts (AWS Cost Explorer, GCP Billing)
- Optimize before scaling (partition tables, compress data, cache results)
- Use spot/preemptible instances for batch jobs

---

### 10. Lack of Clear Ownership and SLAs

**Problem:** Unclear who owns which datasets, no defined SLAs for data freshness/quality.

**Impact:** Data issues go unnoticed, slow incident response, cross-team friction.

**Solution:**
- Implement data contracts (schema, SLA, owner)
- Use data catalogs (DataHub, Amundsen) for discoverability
- Define SLAs for critical datasets (freshness, completeness)
- On-call rotations for data engineering teams

---

## Hands-On Exercises

### Exercise 1: Tech Stack Design for a Use Case

**Scenario:** You're building a real-time content recommendation system for a media streaming platform.

**Requirements:**
- 50M users, 100K content items
- User watch history, ratings, search queries
- Real-time recommendations (<200ms)
- Batch model retraining daily
- Multi-region (US, EU, Asia)
- Team: 10 engineers (5 DE, 3 MLE, 2 DevOps)

**Tasks:**
1. Design the complete tech stack (ingestion, storage, processing, feature store, ML platform, monitoring)
2. Justify each technology choice (why X over Y?)
3. Identify potential bottlenecks and mitigation strategies
4. Estimate monthly infrastructure costs (rough order of magnitude)

**Deliverable:** Architecture diagram + written justification (2-3 pages)

---

### Exercise 2: Feast Feature Store Setup

**Goal:** Deploy Feast locally and implement a simple feature pipeline.

**Tasks:**
1. Install Feast: `pip install feast`
2. Initialize a feature repository: `feast init feature_repo`
3. Define features for an e-commerce use case:
   - User features: total orders, avg order value, days since last order
   - Product features: total sales, avg rating, stock level
4. Generate sample data (Pandas DataFrames)
5. Configure offline store (local Parquet files) and online store (SQLite or Redis)
6. Materialize features to online store
7. Fetch features for training (point-in-time join)
8. Fetch features for serving (online retrieval)

**Deliverable:** Working Feast repository with features, sample data, and Python scripts for training/serving

**Resources:**
- [Feast Quickstart](https://docs.feast.dev/getting-started/quickstart)
- [Feast Tutorial](https://docs.feast.dev/tutorials/building-a-recommendation-system)

---

### Exercise 3: Compare Batch Processing Tools

**Goal:** Understand trade-offs between Pandas, Polars, DuckDB, and Spark.

**Tasks:**
1. Generate a 1GB CSV file (10M rows, 10 columns with mixed types)
2. Implement the same transformation in each tool:
   - Filter rows (e.g., `price > 100`)
   - Group by category and aggregate (sum, mean, count)
   - Join with a reference table (e.g., category metadata)
   - Write results to Parquet
3. Measure:
   - Execution time
   - Memory usage
   - Code complexity (lines of code)
4. Repeat with 10GB dataset (if your machine can handle it)

### Exercise 4: Implement Data Quality Checks

**Goal:** Set up Great Expectations for a realistic dataset.

**Tasks:**
1. Install Great Expectations: `pip install great_expectations`
2. Download a public dataset (e.g., NYC Taxi, Kaggle dataset)
3. Initialize Great Expectations: `great_expectations init`
4. Create an expectation suite with:
   - Schema validation
   - Nullability checks
   - Range checks (e.g., fare amount > 0)
   - Statistical checks (mean, std within expected bounds)
   - Uniqueness checks
5. Run validation and generate data docs
6. Introduce data quality issues (nulls, outliers) and observe failures
7. Integrate with a simple Airflow DAG (validate before processing)

**Deliverable:** Great Expectations config, expectation suite, data docs, Airflow DAG

## Key Takeaways

1. **The ML data engineering tech stack has distinct layers**: programming languages, ingestion, storage, processing, feature stores, ML platforms, monitoring, and orchestration. Each layer has specialized tools optimized for ML workloads.

2. **There's no one-size-fits-all stack**: Technology choices depend on scale, team size, budget, cloud preference, and specific use cases (real-time vs batch, NLP vs tabular data).

3. **Managed vs self-hosted is a fundamental trade-off**: Managed services offer faster time-to-value and lower ops burden but cost more and create vendor lock-in. Self-hosted gives control and cost efficiency at scale but requires expertise.

4. **Open formats provide portability**: Use Parquet, Delta Lake, Iceberg, and Arrow to avoid vendor lock-in and enable multi-engine access to your data.

5. **Feature stores are critical for production ML**: They eliminate training-serving skew, enable feature reuse, and provide low-latency serving. Introduce them early for multi-model projects.

6. **Start simple, scale thoughtfully**: Don't over-engineer. Use Pandas/DuckDB for <100GB, managed services for rapid iteration, and only introduce distributed systems (Spark, Kafka) when necessary.

7. **Version everything**: Data, features, models, code, and infrastructure should all be versioned for reproducibility and debugging.

8. **Build observability from day 1**: Logs, metrics, and traces are essential. Add ML-specific monitoring for data quality, feature drift, and model performance.

9. **Plan for failure**: Distributed systems fail. Implement retries, circuit breakers, checkpointing, and multi-region deployments for critical services.

10. **Emerging technologies are reshaping the landscape**: DuckDB, Polars, Modal, LanceDB, and Iceberg REST Catalog are recent innovations worth monitoring. Evaluate carefully before adopting in production.

11. **Common pitfalls to avoid**: Over-optimization too early, accidental vendor lock-in, ignoring data quality, underestimating operational complexity, and not planning for scalability.

12. **Documentation is infrastructure**: Architecture Decision Records, runbooks, and data contracts are as important as code for long-term system maintainability.
